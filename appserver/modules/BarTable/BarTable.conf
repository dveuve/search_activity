description = This module creates a table of bars each of which is effectively a filler gauge. For this reason this module is compatible with data from the gaugetable command for setting the thresholds at which the colors of the bars change. On click of any row all the fields returned by the search are passed downstream. Also note this module is compatible with with the paginator. 

[param:displayField]
required = True
label = This is the field that will be used to name your different bars in the table. 

[param:totalField]
required = False
label = This is the field that determines the total of the bar to be filled. if unspecified it will default to the largest value of the threshold fields in the first row of data.

[param:valueField]
required = False
label = This is the field that determines the value of the fill of the bar gauge. If unspecified defaults to the x field (this is the output of the gaugetable command).

[param:drilldownPrefix]
required = False
default = click
label = On click all fields for the clicked row will be available as appVars with tokens of "$drilldownPrefix$.$fieldname$"

[param:thresholdFields]
required = False
label = These are the fields used for determining color assignment. By default they are the fields yXX where XX is an int (this is the output of the gaugetable command). Colors are assigned in terms of being between the thresholdFields' values. Thus, there should be 1 more color defined than threshold field. 

[param:colors]
required = False
label = Supply a comma separated list of colors. If you do not provide this list a default color palette will be used. Colors are assigned based on the threshold fields 

[param:icons]
required = False
label = Supply a comma separated list of icons. If you do not provide this list a default color palette will be used. Icons are assigned based on the threshold fields and must be specified with a valid url.
 
[param:addFields]
required = False
label = If desired, provide a comma delimited list of fields you also wish to display the values of as additional columns to the BarTable. If unspecified nothing will be added.
